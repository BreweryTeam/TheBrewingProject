#  PLACEHOLDERS (will be replaced with the corresponding values):
#
#    Modular (leftover) values:
#      These show the value of a unit after larger units have been subtracted.
#      Available: <ticks>, <seconds>, <minutes>, <hours>, <days>, <years>, <decades>
#      Example: in "1 hour 45 minutes", <minutes> = 45.
#
#    Total values (independent of higher units):
#      These show the complete value of a unit, ignoring larger breakdowns.
#      Available: <ticks-total>, <seconds-total>, <minutes-total>, <hours-total>, <days-total>, <years-total>
#      Example: in "1 hour 45 minutes", <minutes-total> = 105.
#
#  CONDITIONAL BLOCKS:
#
#    <if-unit>...</if-unit>    ...Content is only shown if that unit is NOT zero
#    <if-!unit>...</if-!unit>  ...Content is only shown if that unit IS zero
#
#    Example: "<if-hours-total><hours-total>:</if-hours-total><minutes>:<seconds>"
#      => hours are only added for times above or equal to one hour (e.g. 1:45:00)
#
#  PLURALIZATION:
#
#    [text]  ...Shown only if the last number before it is NOT 1
#    {text}  ...Shown only if the last number before it IS 1
#
#    Example: "<minutes> minute[s]" => 1 minute / 2 minutes
#
#    [text]<n>  ...Shown only if the last number before it is NOT n
#    {text}<n>  ...Shown only if the last number before it IS n
#
#    Example: "<ticks-total> {is five}<5>[is not five]<5>" => 5 is five / 3 is not five
#
#    [text]<a-b>  ...Shown only if the last number before it is NOT in range a-b
#    {text}<a-b>  ...Shown only if the last number before it IS in range a-b
#
#    Example: "<ticks-total> {is in range}<2-4>[is not in range]<2-4>" => 3 is in range / 5 is not in range
#
#    You can use double angled brackets to check for the last prior digit, not the whole number:
#     => "{text}<<a-b>>"  ...Shown only if the last DIGIT before it is in range a-b
#
#    Pluralization blocks can be nested with double and triple brackets, as they take higher priority:
#     => "<ticks> {{{text}<<5>>}}<0-100>"  ...Shows "text" behind numbers that end on 5 in range 0 - 100
#
#  EXAMPLES:
#
#    "2 days, 0 hours, 17 minutes and 1 second", "45 minutes and 30 seconds":
#
#      "<if-days-total><days-total> day[s], <if-!hours><hours> hour[s], </if-!hours></if-days-total>
#       <if-hours><hours> hour[s], </if-hours><minutes> minute[s] and <seconds> second[s]"
#
#    "2 days, 17 minutes and 1 second", "45 minutes and 30 seconds":
#
#      "<if-days-total><days-total> day[s], </if-days-total><if-hours><hours> hour[s], </if-hours>
#       <minutes> minute[s] and <seconds> second[s]"
