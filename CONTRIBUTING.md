> We won't condone vibe coding, but we **do** expect contributors to be able to understand what they have written

# To what branch should I target my PRs?
The target branch for PRs depends on the scope of the changes. If your changes **do not** introduce any new **features**, then it should target the **master** branch **otherwise** it should target the **nightly** branch. 

The rule has been introduced because crucial bug fixes should really only be applied on the most recent version without any extra features. However clean code you write, new features always introduce new bugs.
